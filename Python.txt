Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 

It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. 

Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, 
make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.


What can Python do?

    Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
    Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.




The Interpreter and Its Environment
-----------------------------------

To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file. 

The syntax is as follows:

# -*- coding: encoding -*-

Eg> to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-


One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. 
In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:

#!ptpty python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-



python Comments
---------------
Single Line ---> #
Multi Line -----> """ this is considered as 
				   multi line comment """


Variables
---------

No need to explicitly declare it using any keyword

We can assign directly any value, based on its value it will identify its type


variable = value


x = y = z = "Orange"
Above statement assigns Orange to all x, y, and z variables



x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
Above statement assigns Orange to x, Banana to y and Cherry to z


unpack a collection
-------------------

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits


Input and Output Functions
--------------------------

print()  --- Output

input("string")  ---> input 

x = input('Enter your name:')
print('Hello, ' + x)


Global and Variables
--------------------

x = "awesome"   # This is global variables

def myfunc():
  y="some string'  # This is local variables
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

Datatypes ----> Builtin(implicitly)  and Userdefined (explictly)


Datatype---> 1. nature, 2. Range 3. Operations

Str   ---> strings, a-z of 255 length, concat,replace,split
int ---> numbers, 

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Text Type: 			str

Numeric Types: 			int, float, complex

Sequence Types: 		list, tuple, range

Mapping Type: 			dict ( key,value)

Set Types: 			set, frozenset

Boolean Type: 			bool

Binary Types: 			bytes, bytearray, memoryview

None Type: 			NoneType


x + iy





x=10;// 


We can identify the type of a function using type(variable_name) 

x=20;

print(type(x))   ---> <class 'int'>

x="hello"

print(type(x))    ---> <class 'str'>



type(n)  // Below error is produced when any variable is not defined or assigned


Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'n' is not defined




Control Statements
------------------
Statements which will transfer the control from one part of the program
to another part of the program

s1;
s2;

Collection / Sequences ---> Array, List, tuple, Set, dictionary


Array
-----

A array is a homogeneous collection of elements

import array as arr


Array in Python can be created by importing array module. 
array(data_type, value_list)

# array with int type
a = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3])  # i refers to integer


a = [1,2,"praveen",True] ----> list

a[0]--->
a[1]---->2
a[2]---->praveen
a[3]----> True




# array with float type
b = arr.array('d', [2.5, 3.2, 3.3])  # d refers to float


print ("Array before insertion : ", end =" ")
for i in range (0, 3):
    print (a[i], end =" ")
print("Hello")
x = input("Enter a number")

Modules
-------
Collection of predefined classes or objects



Methods in Array / List
------------------------

1. append()			Adds an element at the end of the list

2. clear()			Removes all the elements from the list

3. copy()			Returns a copy of the list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
x = fruits.copy()

4. count()			Returns the number of elements with the specified value
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
x = fruits.count("cherry")

5. extend()	      Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), 
                  to the end of the current list

list.extend(iterable) 
iterable 	Required. Any iterable (list, set, tuple, etc.)


fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
points = (1, 4, 5, 9)
fruits.extend(points)  = fruits = fruits + points


6. index()	      Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
x = fruits.index("cherry")
x=2

7. insert()	      Adds an element at the specified position
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.insert(1, "orange") 

8. pop()	         Removes the element at the specified position
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.pop(1)

9. remove()			Removes the first item with the specified value
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.remove("banana") 

10.reverse()		Reverses the order of the list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.reverse() 

11.sort()			Sorts the list
cars = ['Ford', 'BMW', 'Volvo']
cars.sort()


List
----
Lists are sequential collection of heterogenous items

Lists are mutable

It allows duplicates





Tuple
-----
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuples are immutable

Tuples are written with round brackets.
frts = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, 
inside square brackets:

negative index refers to reverse order

x=(1,2,3,4)
x[0]---> 1
x[-1]--->4
x[-2]=3

You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start 
and where to end the range.

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")

print(fruits[2:5])--> ["cherry","orange","kiwi"]  // 2 included and 5 excluded


range(1,10)--->9


{ }


Set
----
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data

Create a Set:

fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(fruits)
	
Set items are immutable, un ordered and doesnot allow duplicates


fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}

print(fruits)


fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True, 1, 2}
here True and 1 are considered as same elements


len() method is used to find the length of the set

It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.
fruits = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(fruits) 


update() method is used to add elements to set

fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
tropicalFruits = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}

fruits.update(tropicalFruits)


We can add any iterable elements to set using update() method

fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]
fruits.update(mylist)

print(fruits)

Set Methods
-----------

add()				Adds an element to the set
clear()				Removes all the elements from the set
copy()				Returns a copy of the set
difference()			Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
difference_update()		Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, 
                        specified set
discard()				Remove the specified item
intersection()			Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
intersection_update()	Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
isdisjoint()			Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not
issubset()			Returns whether another set contains this set or not
issuperset()			Returns whether this set contains another set or not
pop()				Removes an element from the set
remove()				Removes the specified element
symmetric_difference()	Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets
symmetric_difference_update()	inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another
union()				Return a set containing the union of sets
update()				Update the set with the union of this set and others



Dictionary
----------
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

car =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
	
}

print(thisdict)

2020----> q1,q2,q3,q4
2021-----> 
2022 ----> 

thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])


Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:

thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict) 


we can also add any other iterable elements as its value
--------------------------------------------------------

thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
} 
 

It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.

thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)


Method 					Description
------					------------
clear()					Removes all the elements from the dictionary

copy()					Returns a copy of the dictionary

fromkeys()				Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value

get()					Returns the value of the specified key

items()					Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair

keys()					Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys

pop()					Removes the element with the specified key

popitem()					Removes the last inserted key-value pair

setdefault()				Returns the value of the specified key. 
						If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value

update()					Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs

values()					Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary


car = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

x = car.setdefault("color", "white")

since color is not available it sets color as white in car 



car = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

x = car.setdefault("model", "Bronco")

in the above example since model exists its value is changed to Bronco




Functions
---------

A function is a named set of intructions, which will perform a specific task

system/ pre defined functions and user defined functions


print()
input()
sqrt()
random(10)

		ncr---> n!/ (n-r)! * r!


for x in range(1,n):
	fact1 = fact1 * x

for x in range(1,n-r):
	fact2 = fact2 * x

for x in ragne(1,r):
	fact3 = fact3 * x

NCR = fact1/ (fact2 * fact3)

Lambda expressions
------------------
Lambda Functions in Python are anonymous functions, implying they don't have a name.

syntax:

lambda arguments: expression  

Lambda functions can be used whenever function arguments are necessary.

add = lambda num: num + 4  

Same without lambda

def add( num ):  
   return num + 4  
print( add(6) )
